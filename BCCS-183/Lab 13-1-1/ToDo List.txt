Implement the functionality to close the garage door via the browser.

    Create a new IoT connector to connect the SBC with the garage door.
    Configure the new connector to allow the SBC to issue a request to the door for it to close.
    Test the connection and ensure that the door can be closed successfully.

Update the web interface layout.

    Ensure that the layout remains the same as the previous stage.
    Add an additional IoT connector to the existing layout to represent the connection with the garage door.

Update the web interface to display the door status automatically.
    Update the existing code to include the new URL: http://127.0.0.1:8765/show_status.
    Implement the redirection functionality, so any non-implemented URL is redirected to http://127.0.0.1:8765/show_status.
    Test the web interface to verify that it automatically updates with the door status.

Implement the functionality to close the door using Alt-clicking or a specific link with a password.
    Add a link on the show_status page to allow the door to be closed.
    Implement the logic to check for the correct password before closing the door.
    If an incorrect password is entered, display an error message to the user and redirect them back to the show_status page after a few seconds.
    If the correct password is entered, inform the user that the garage door is closing, and redirect them to the show_status page after a few seconds.
    Test the functionality by closing the door using Alt-clicking and the link with the password.

Handle the case when the door needs to be closed before enabling/disabling the alarm.
    If the door is manually opened by Alt-clicking, and the user clicks on the enable/disable alarm link on the show_status page, display a warning message that the door needs to be closed first.
    Display the message for a few seconds and automatically redirect the user to the show_status page.
    Verify that the door is still shown as open in the updated status.

Implement the functionality to enable/disable the alarm.
    Add a link on the show_status page to enable/disable the alarm.
    Implement the logic to check for the correct password before enabling/disabling the alarm.
    If an incorrect password is entered, display an error message to the user and redirect them back to the show_status page after a few seconds.
    If the correct password is entered, immediately redirect the user to the show_status page where the enabled alarm status can be seen.
    Verify that the status is shown in the LCD.

Update the web interface to trigger the alarm when the door is opened.
    Implement the logic to detect when the door is opened (Alt-clicked) and trigger the alarm.
    Ensure that the alarm status is automatically updated on the show_status page.

Implement the functionality to disable the alarm before closing the door.
    If the user attempts to close the door with the alarm enabled, display a message informing them that the alarm needs to be disabled first.
    After a few seconds, automatically redirect the user to the show_status page.
    Add a link to enable/disable the alarm, and implement the logic to check the correct password before enabling/disabling it.
    If the correct password is entered, automatically redirect the user to the show_status page where the disabled alarm status can be seen.
    Verify that the alarm indicator is off and the LCD shows the current state.

Update the web interface to allow closing the door only if it is open.

    If the user clicks on the close door link on the show_status page and the door is closed, display a message informing them that the door is not open.
    After a few seconds, automatically redirect the user to the show_status page.
    Test the functionality by attempting to close the door when it is closed.

Apply code requirements.
    Ensure that all objects are appropriately typed and named.
    Include comments in the code for better understanding.
    Add docstrings to functions to provide descriptions and usage information.

Experiment and test the code in a separate instance of PacketTracer.
    Use the provided code in the section of Moodle for customizing the garage door.
    Apply the same approach to the Stage 3 code once you can successfully close the door from the SBC.
    Test the code thoroughly to ensure it functions as intended.

Create more HTML files for the web interface.
    Modify existing HTML files slightly to create additional pages.
    This will help in implementing the required functionality and improving the user experience.

Remember to proceed with these steps while keeping the overall architecture and requirements of the project in mind.
