        <h2>About this example</h2>
        <p>This example shows a simple layout change from a single-column to two columns when the viewport (window) is wide enough to fit two columns. Notice that the layout code for the single column occurs first and is not in a media query - this makes the single column the 'default' layout. This is a good approach because browsers that don't understand media queries and/or grid (such as Internet Explorer until recently) can still display the single-column layout. At the bottom of this stylesheet there is a media query that tests the width of the viewport and contains the grid layout.</p>
        <p>Check what happens when you change the width of the browser window from very narrow to very wide when you are viewing the web page.</p>
        <p>The default layout (before any media queries take effect) is a single-column layout with the principal structural elements as blocks in normal flow. That is: the header, main, and aside are allowed to take their normal positions one after the other down the window. We don't need a grid or other layout CSS for this.</p>
