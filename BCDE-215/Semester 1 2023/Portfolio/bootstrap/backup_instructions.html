                    <p>For safety, you should set up regular, automated backups of your instance. Backups will add a
                        very small charge to your account, but are rather important.</p>

                    <h2>A cautionary tale</h2>
                    <p>A few years ago a student ran a command in the wrong location on their instance and managed to
                        remove their ability to do much on their instance. They had to create a new instance. If you
                        have backups of your instance, you can quickly (less than a minute) create a new instance with
                        all your projects, data, etc. from backup.</p>
                    <p>Technical explanation: The student accidentally changed the ownership of the sudoers file to
                        ubuntu instead of root. This meant that they were unable to use sudo. Therefore, they could not
                        use sudo to restore the correct ownership of the sudoers file. This is known as an own goal…

                <section>
                    <h2>Create a backup plan</h2>
                    <p>Go to the AWS Backup service in your AWS control panel. NOTE: This is not part of EC2 – it is a
                        separate service.</p>
                    <p>Click the “Create Backup plan” button. </p>
                    <p>On the Create Backup plan > Start options panel, do the following:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Make sure “Start with a template” is selected.</li>
                        <li>From the “Choose template” dropdown, select “Daily-35day-Retention”.</li>
                        <li>Enter a name like “EC2InstanceBackup” in the “Backup plan name” box.</li>
                    </ol>
                    See the screenshot below to see what the screen should look like at this point.

                    </p>
                    <p>To save this backup plan, scroll down and click the “Create Plan” button.</p>
                    <p>This will take you back to the summary screen for the backup plan. NOTE: your instance has not
                        yet been added to the plan - carry on to the next page here in order to do this…</p>

                    <h2>Add your instance to the backup plan</h2>
                    <p>On the summary screen, click the “Assign resources” button.</p>
                    <p>Go to the “Assign resources” panel.</p>
                    <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>On this panel in the General section you need to enter a resource assignment name, such as
                            “MyInstance”.</li>
                        <li>Then in the Assign Resources section leave it set to “Include all resource types”.</li>
                        <li>To finish this panel, click the “Assign Resources” button.</li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>See the screenshot below:<br>

                    <h2>Check your backup is running</h2>
                    <p>The first backup will occur within 24 hours, so you will probably need to wait until tomorrow
                        before checking as follows.</p>
                    <p>To check that your instance is being backed up, go to the EC2 control panel and under Elastic
                        Block Store in the left-hand menu, select Snapshots. This is where your backups (“snapshots”)
                        will be listed. Initially, there will just be one, but each day another will be added. See the
                        image below.<br>
