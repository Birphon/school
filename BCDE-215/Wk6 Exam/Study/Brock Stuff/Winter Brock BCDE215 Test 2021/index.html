		<p>The lighthouse at <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Reinga">Cape Reinga</a>
		was built in 1941 and first lit during May of that year, replacing a lighthouse
		located on nearby <span class="place-name">Motuopao Island</span>, which 
		had been built 1879. In 1987, the lighthouse was fully automated and the lighthouse 
		keepers were withdrawn. The previous 1000 watt light and its revolving Fresnel 
		lens have since been replaced with a tiny 50 watt flashing beacon, lodged in their 
		place in the huge lantern.</p>
		<p>Cape Reinga, sometimes spelled Rе̄inga, and officially Cape 
		Reinga / Te Rerenga Wairua, is the northwesternmost tip of the 
		<span class="place-name">Aupouri Peninsula</span>, at the northern end of the 
		North Island of New Zealand.</p>
