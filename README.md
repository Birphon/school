# School Work

This is a repo that holds the salvaged Ara School work that I have. Some classes are missing and have been lost to the sands of time. These include but aren't limited to (as I am going off memory):

- Introduction to Programming (BCDE101) - JavaScript

- Introduction to Software Engineering (BCDE102) - JavaScript

- Interactive Media Development (BCDE213) - Html/CSS/JS

- Best Programing Practices (Server Side Programming) (BCDE224) - PHP
