INSTRUCTIONS

Make the web page responsive. There aren't any screenshots this time - design your own.

Before you start coding, plan the designs - create wireframes showing the page structure like we do in class.

Start with the next size up from the single column design (uh, two columns?). Work out how wide each of its columns will be and create a media query to match that total width (plus 2ems for the scroll bar).
