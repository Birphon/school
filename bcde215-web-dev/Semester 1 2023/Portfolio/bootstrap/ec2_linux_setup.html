                    <h2>Prerequisite</h2>
                    <p>You need an Amazon Web Services account.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>AWS Account Security</h2>
                    <p>If your AWS account is compromised, someone can add resources to it such as powerful EC2
                        instances,
                        which are very expensive. This happened to a student recently: his account was compromised and
                        he
                        suddenly had a charge of about US$500 for a month. He did manage to have Amazon reverse the
                        charge,
                        but it took time and was stressful. So, my advice is:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Do not re-use passwords from other services/websites you have accounts with. Reusing
                            passwords
                            is VERY UNWISE and is how the above student’s account was compromised.</li>
                        <li>Set up multi-factor authentication for your AWS root user account. See the following video
                            tutorial:
                            <a href="https://pages.awscloud.com/how-to-enable-multi-factor-authentication-for-aws-account.html"

                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </section>

                <!-- Section: Programs -->
                <section>
                    <h2>Programs</h2>
                    <p>The programs we need are available via your Ara login account. You can also download them on your
                        own
                        computers.</p>

                    <h3>PuTTY & PuTTYgen</h3>
                    <p>PuTTY is a terminal program for connecting to the server and managing it. PuTTYgen can convert
                        keys
                        to different formats.</p>
                    <p>Mac equivalent to PuTTY: use the Terminal program in your Utilities folder. Your key file will
                        need
                        to be in .pem format for OpenSSH (Puttygen can do that conversion – discuss with your lecturer).
                    </p>
                    <p>To download PuTTY on your own computer, go to
                        <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html"
                            target="_blank">https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html</a>
                        and download the standalone programs from the “Alternative binary files” section (not from the
                        “Package files” section). You probably need this one:
                    </p>
                    <p>putty.exe (the SSH and Telnet client itself) – the 64-bit x86 version</p>

                    <h3>WinSCP</h3>
                    <p>WinSCP is an FTP program for connecting to the server and uploading and editing files.</p>
                    <p>Mac equivalent: Cyberduck.</p>
                </section>

                <!-- Section: Create an AWS EC2 instance -->
                <section>
                    <h2>Create an AWS EC2 instance (a.k.a. cloud server)</h2>
                    <p>Log in to your AWS account and go to the EC2 service.</p>

                    <h3>AWS Zone</h3>
                    <p>AWS provides many services in “zones” around the globe. Set your zone to Asia Pacific Sydney
                        before
                        creating an EC2 instance:</p>
                    <img src="img/aws_zone.png" alt="AWS Zone" class="img-fluid">

                    <h3>Launch an Instance</h3>
                    <p>Click the orange “Launch Instances” button.</p>
                    <p>Refer to the “New Instance Settings” screenshot on Moodle for the settings to use – it is too
                        large
                        to paste here.</p>
                    <p>One of the options to select involves creating a new key pair. Choose the .ppk format. See the
                        following
                        screenshot:</p>

                <!-- Section: Get a fixed IP address -->
                <section>
                    <h2>Get a fixed IP address (an “Elastic IP”) for the instance</h2>
                    <p>You need an IP address for the instance that won’t be changed if you stop (=shut down) and then
                        start
                        (=start up) your instance – this is called an “Elastic IP”. In the EC2 console select “Elastic
                        IPs”
                        (from the list at left) and then click the “Allocate Elastic IP address” button. Click the
                        Allocate
                        button to create the Elastic IP address.</p>
                    <p>Now you need to associate that Elastic IP address with your EC2 instance. Select the Elastic IP
                        address in the list (it will be selected by default). From the “Actions” dropdown menu select
                        “Associate Elastic IP address”. Choose your instance in the Instance dropdown and click the
                        Associate
                        button.</p>
                    <p>NOTE: An Elastic IP address is an AWS resource. It is included in the free tier as long as it is
                        in
                        use, which means that the instance it is associated with is running. If you stop your instance,
                        charging for the Elastic IP will begin – so, keep your instance running all the time.</p>

                <!-- Section: Convert the key file -->
                <section>
                    <h2>Convert the key file to the newer format</h2>
                    <p>For security reasons, Ubuntu 22.04 does not support v2 PPK key files. However, when you created a
                        key that is the format that was used. So, you need to start the Puttygen program and follow
                        these
                        steps:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Click the Load button and find and open (load) the PPK key file you created.</li>
                        <li>From the Key menu, choose “Parameters for saving key files…”</li>
                        <li>Choose PPK file version 3 and click OK.</li>
                        <li>Click the “Save private key” button (N.B. not public key).</li>
                        <li>When asked if you want to save it without a passphrase, click Yes.</li>
                        <li>Save the key file somewhere sensible and do not lose it! You can make copies of it, but
                            store them securely.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Mac Users: If you want to use a Mac (using the Terminal program), you will need to convert the
                        PPK
                        file to .pem format. This can be done in Puttygen by loading the key as above, but then instead
                        of doing step 4 choose “Export OpenSSH Key” from the Export menu.</p>

                <!-- Section: Connect to the instance -->
                <section>
                    <h2>Connect to the instance (server) using a terminal session (SSH)</h2>
                    <p>Start PuTTY.</p>
                    <p>Note: You can also AWS’s console (a web-based terminal emulator), although I find the behaviour
                        when trying to paste text commands unreliable, which is annoying. To start the console, select
                        your instance in the EC2 control panel and click “Connect”. Then select “EC2 Instance Connect
                        (browser-based SSH connection)”.</p>
                    <p>Follow these steps in PuTTY to connect to your instance to verify it has been created correctly:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Enter the public IP address of your instance as the Host Name.</li>
                        <li>(Optional:) Select Window > Appearance from the left panel and increase the font size to
                            12-point or larger. I also prefer the Consolas font.</li>
                        <li>Select Connection > Data from the left panel, enter ubuntu as the Auto-login username (it
                            is case sensitive).</li>
                        <li>Select Connection > SSH > Auth from the left panel, click the Browse… button to locate the
                            version 3 .ppk key file you created with PuTTYgen and click Open.</li>
                        <li>Select Session from the left panel, click the Save button, and provide a name (e.g., AWS
                            Instance).</li>
                        <li>Click Open to start the SSH session.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>When prompted, click Yes to add the EC2 instance to your PuTTY cache.</p>
                    <p>You should now be connected to your EC2 instance via SSH.</p>
